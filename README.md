# Random String Generator
### Allows the user to enter certain options, and the code will generate a string of characters based on the input.

- First input: Enter the length of the string

- Second input: The type of characters you want (Note: You can combine numbers, i.e 123 = Lowercase, Uppercase & Numbers):<br>
1 = Lowercase<br>
2 = Uppercase<br>
3 = Numbers<br>
4 = Special characters<br>
5 = All of the above<br>
- Third input: The amount of strings you want to generate, i.e, if you enter 5 in this option, it will generate 5 random strings.

## How to run this:
- Open the terminal (Command prompt/CMD)
- Move to the directory where the file is located
- Type either ```py string_gen.py``` or ```python3 string_gen.py```
and press enter to run.<br>
- You can also run the [run.bat](https://github.com/its-Jaxx/String-Generator/blob/main/run.bat) file included<br>
[What is a bat file?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file)
